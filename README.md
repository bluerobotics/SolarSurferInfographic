# SolarSurferInfographic

Live, public-facing information source for the SolarSurfer project.

## Info Requirements

This is a list of data that we'd like to see in the infographic.

* motivation/about
  * mission statement and motivation
  * video of launch day or most recent update
* stats
  * time since launch, distance traveled
  * graph battery SoC, solar power, thruster power; rotating thruster pictures w/ revoluation count?
  * sensor information
  * distance remaining, other stats?
* map
  * commanded waypoint path (parse commands)
  * actual path (parse history)
  * estimate path remaining (sim output)
* graph
  * open-ended display off all mission data - can add and remove channels

## Layout Ideas

* single page with lots of scrolling? maybe some fancy visualization between sections?
* could do different pages a la SolarSurferCommander, but this is less appealing
