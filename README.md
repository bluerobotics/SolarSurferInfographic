# SolarSurferInfographic

Live, public-facing information source for the SolarSurfer project.

## Layout plan

* motivation/launch - paragraph + static SS image that open a modal to a video of launch day; time since launch, distance traveled
* map - show waypoint line (parse commands), show actual path (parse history), show estimate path remaining (sim output)
* power - graph battery SoC, solar power, thruster power; rotating thruster pictures w/ revoluation count?
* sensors - graph lots of sensors or something
* landing - distance remaining, other stats?

other other stats?
